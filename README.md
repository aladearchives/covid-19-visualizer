## covid-19-visualizer
This Project is created using an API to visualize data for Corona Virus Cases by country. You can view infected, recovered as well as number of deaths.
### Stack 
I made use of React Hooks and Class Components as well as an API. Fetching was done using Axios Library and the Display Chart uses React-Chartjs-v2. Material UI Design Components were also used for the cards and FlexBox for the Component Layout.
